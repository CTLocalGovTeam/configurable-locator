        <h1>How to use the Event Locator</h1>
	    <p>The <b>Event Locator</b> application can be used by citizens and visitors to discover activities and events occurring in a community.<br/>  <br/>To locate an event, simply enter an address, or search using a range of dates in which you are interested.  Or, you can use your current location to find an event or activity near you.  The event or activity will then be highlighted on the map and relevant information presented to you.</p>
	    <h3><u>Using the Application</u></h3>
	    <p>The Event Locator application provides residents and visitors an easy way to find events or activities near them, or events taking place on specific dates.

If you click the Current Location button, it will use the location of your computer's IP address or your cell phone/tablet location to locate events near you. When you enter an address or use your current location, the application will present a list of events and activities near you and allow you to review relevant information about each.<br/>  <br/>Once you have found an event or activity you are interested in, click the "Add to My List" button in the info-popup window or in the information panel.  Once events have been added to your list, you can order them by the dates on which they occur, calculate a route between them, add events to your personal calendar or print your list of events for later use.</p>
